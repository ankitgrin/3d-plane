# Virtual Wings

**Virtual Wings** is a 3D website where a plane flies between clouds against a dynamically changing sky background. It was built using Three.js for 3D rendering, GSAP animation library for smooth animations, and Lamina library for creating the dynamic sky background effect. The inspiration and guidance for this project were taken from a YouTube tutorial by Wawa Sensei.

## Features

- **3D Plane Animation**: The website features a 3D model of a plane that flies smoothly across the screen.
- **Clouds Animation**: Clouds are dynamically generated and animated, providing a realistic environment for the plane to navigate through.
- **Dynamic Sky Background**: The color of the sky changes gradually as the user scrolls down the webpage, creating a visually immersive experience.
- **Interactive Scroll**: The user can control the speed and direction of the plane's flight by scrolling up or down.

## Credits

- **Wawa Sensei**: The tutorial by Wawa Sensei provided guidance and inspiration for building this project.
